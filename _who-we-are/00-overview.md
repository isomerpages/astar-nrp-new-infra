## Who we are
The National Robotics Programme (NRP) is a multi-agency national programme that looks at the end-to-end development of differentiating robotics enablers and solutions in Singapore, from funding R&amp;D to facilitating partnerships for translation and adoption to maximise socio-economic impact. Tour around our website to find out more!

## Our Vision
&gt;"We envision a vibrant and innovative robotics ecosystem capable of providing solutions to fuel the Smart Nation initiative and to establish Singapore as a global centre of excellence for the study, research, development, making and applications of robotics solutions."  
  
\- *Professor Quek Tong Boon, Chief Executive, National Robotics Programme*  
  
## Our Logo

The rounded square on the left represents a robot and the circle on the right represents a person. They are encapsulated by a larger rounded rectangle, signifying the harmony of robots and people working together. Teaming between robots and people is further symbolised by the red colour (from the square) extending as a little black circle into the red circle. Taken together, the graphics with our tagline "Robotics Empowering People" serve to underscore our focus on robotics that enable people to have better lives and better jobs, to contribute to a better society and economy. Just like Rosie in The Jetsons, or R2D2 and C3PO in Star Wars!
