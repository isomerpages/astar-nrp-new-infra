- title: "A Self-reconfigurable Class of Maintenance Robots"
  desc: Self-reconfigurable robotics is a new class of robots that possess the ability to autonomously adapt their morphologies to overcome complexities posed by the environment. Our current efforts address the challenges posed by fixed morphology robots in the maintenance sector by applying self-reconfigurable principles.
