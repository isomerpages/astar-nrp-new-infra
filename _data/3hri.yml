- title: "Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) Phase 1"
  desc: The next generation of robots will coexist in human living environments such as factories, service industry, and healthcare to tackle complex tasks.  The goal of this research project is to develop the enabling technologies for effective interactions between humans and robots, focusing on novel mechatronics structure design to ensure safe physical human robot interaction; human cognitive state modeling and understanding; multimodal sensing integration natural language and vision for effective human robot communication; and integrated decision-making; intelligent task sharing and execution.
