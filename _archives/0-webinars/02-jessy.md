## Webinar Takeaways
1. Shifting the industry's mindset from manual labour to automated robotics is challenging as solutions need to look at the entire end-to-end ecosystem for things to work.
2. Technology needs to have the end-users in mind, such that it could be easily used by the operator without technical knowledge.
3. Robots should be used as their capabilities allow, rather than replace a human's working method.
