## Webinar Takeaways
1. Safety is key within the compliant motion, where the robot can interact with human input.
2. Collaboration through haptics is growing in importance for remote work and dangerous tasks.
3. The future of collaborative robot control architecture is multi-layered: human interface, functional autonomy, robots, and the environment. This architecture would be at the intersection of multiple fields such as perception, reasoning, human movement, control, ethics, etc.
