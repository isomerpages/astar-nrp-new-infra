## Webinar Takeaways
1. Certification and lab testing by the right bodies is important to instill confidence in the public for deployment.
2. Robotics should not focus too much on just the task itself (e.g. disinfecting places), but should also look at the gaps that the robot is unable to fill in and come up with practical workflows to compensate for this.
3. Upscaling of jobs with robotics would prove over time that these are meant to empower people's lives.
4. Robotics cannot be used to solve everything, but it should be robust during its implementation in targeted areas.
