## Webinar Takeaways
The Covid-19 pandemic has changed our world – the way we do business, the way we learn, and even the way we live. Ngee Ann Polytechnic’s (NP) inaugural virtual Robotics Symposium showed how science, technology and innovation can offer solutions to overcome some of the challenges brought forth by the pandemic. Jointly organised by NP’s Robotics Research & Innovation Centre and our industry partners, this half-day symposium focused on the latest innovations and best practices in robotics, and how it can transform organisations.
