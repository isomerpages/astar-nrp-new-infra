## Overview  
The National Robotics Programme supports robotics R&D projects through 2 funding initiatives (FI); [Robotics Enabling Capability Technology (RECT)](/who-we-are/abbreviations/#rect) and [Robotics Domain Specific (RDS)](/who-we-are/abbreviations/#rds).

RECT FI focuses on building Robotics technologies applicable to use cases in domain sectors that Singapore is keen to develop; whereas RDS FI co-funds projects with public agencies in [Healthcare](/research/healthcare/), [Built Environment](/research/built-environment/), and [Environmental Services](/research/environmental-services/) to innovate robotic solutions for their problem statements.
  
## NRP R&D Focus Areas ## {#rect}

## Proof-of-Concept and Proof-of-Value Projects ## {#rds}
NRP partners with public lead demand agencies to develop POC/POV prototype robotic solutions for the use cases identified. The 3 public domains that NRP focus on are [Healthcare](/research/healthcare/), [Built Environment](/research/built-environment/) and [Environmental Services](/research/environment/).
